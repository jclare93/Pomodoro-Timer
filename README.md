# Pomodoro-Timer

This is a web application based on the Pomodoro timer, which is based on the Pomodoro technique. The technique is designed to help people with time management in relation to work or studying. 
The system is broken down into periods of active "focus" and "breaks". The defaults for this application is 25 minutes of studying followed by a 5 minute break. However, if they wish, the user can edit these periods to their liking. A user can also use this application in the background, because the application also provides an alarm when each period(break/focus) finishes. Another interesting feature for this program is that there is a progress bar at the bottom of the page.

Hopefully this will help you improve your work productivity.
